# Data_visualisation
An attempt to visualise data in python and perform exploratory analysis.

The dataset used is real dataset containing the <a href='https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/vipul_chhabra_research_iiit_ac_in/EQ62devsuhpCqknByjZ0tzkBhmkiXGGN2d10unWr152e9g?e=cm6AOo'>data</a> from Makaan.com.

The following requirements provided by the investors and appropriate visualizations are plotted.
- Every investor has different budget ranges, so divide the overall opportunities into three ranges.
- Some investors are interested only in tech-emerging cities like Hyderabad, Banglore, and Chennai with ready-to-move properties for leasing purposes.
- Some prefer larger area properties with relatively lesser budgets.
- Some investors prefer making all the investments in one locality, while some are interested in diversifying the portfolio by assets spread across one city.
- Some investors are interested in knowing the hotspot for their offices in Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
